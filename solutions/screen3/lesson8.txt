SCREEN03

In lesson 8, screen03, we learn about characters and writing strings.  Text characters are stored in memory as a sequence, just like everything else.  There are two types of fonts: vector fonts and bitmap fonts.  Vector fonts allow scalability at any resolution; however are very complext to implement.  For that reason we use fixed size, or "monospace", bitmap fonts, which are essentially a matrices of 1's and 0's that represents where to draw pixels.  This coneveniently works with our previous lesson which allowed us to a pixel at a certain x/y coordinate.  The draw function goes row by row looking for coordinates to set pixels, making up a letter.  For example the letter A below:
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Additionally there is a decision to make about how to number these fonts.  The two choices are unicode and ASCII.  Unicode lists every useful symbol as a number.  This results in a rather large set of values and a more complex encoding.  ASCII focuses on the latin alphabet, numbers, and a few symbles so the set is much smaller and easier to encode.  There are 128 values requiring only 7 bits to represent each value.
Writing strings is essentially just an extension of writing characters.  During the lesson I first attempted drawing a character to the screen before attempting the full string to ensure correct functionality.  A string is just a sequence of characters, which as I stated before is just a sequence of numbers.  Writing a string involves first getting the ASCII value for the character, calling draw character, posititioning the x/y coordinates to the end of the first character and repeating.  The function can take two behaviors.  Continue printing characters until a null value is found (ASCII value 0) or give the string the length of the string.  For simplicity we just give it the length and loop as many times as necessary.
The final part of this lesson deals with the cmdline.  The cmdline is a set of useful infomation like the MAC Address, serial number and screen resolution stored by the ARM processor in the ATAGs at address 0x100.  Additionally IO found this information can in the same directory as the kernel7.img file on the Raspberry Pi called cmdline.txt.  This isn't the only information stored at this location, there are also tags for core and mem; however cmdline contains a string so it's the best fit for this lesson.

I spent two whole days trying to figure out an issue that wasn't allowing me to complete this lesson.  I gained some valueable debugging experience and even created a function to flash error codes via the LED.  It seems that I'm not the first person to face this challenge.  Many people got stuck in this lesson on even the early versions of the raspberry pi.  The issue lies in the include binary declaration. This declaration eats up a rather large chunk of memory in the data section.  Looking at the memory maps before and after adding this code we can see that the framebufferinfo address is the first data in the data section.  After the lesson the font.bin file takes up this space moving the framebufferinfo deeper into memory.  According the the course's creator, Alex Chadwick, there is an issue that makes this new location is unacceptable for use as the framebufferinfo address.  Alex states he does not know what areas of memory this affects.  It's seemingly a guess and check problem. After many failed attempts and hours of debugging I finally got something working.  The only way I could get it to work is by limiting the size of the font.bin file to only a few characters.  This made sense because this effectively changes the address location of the framebufferinfo.  At the end of the day I was able to print a single character to the screen. Success! Soon after I found I could explicitly state where the framebufferinfo structure would go through modifications of the kernel.ld linker file and make file. I placed the framebufferinfo structure at the first position at address 0x9000 and let the font.bin data fall in behind it.  Then after twiddling with the alignment and order of the data statements I was able to actually fit the entire font.bin file without the framebuffer crashing.  Finally, I attempted the full solution and was able to print the commandline.  My theory is the framebufferinfo structure must exist in a specific place in memory in which both the GPU and CPU can access it.  Adding the font.bin data moved the address and made inaccessible.  I'm still looking into a definite answer on this, but with limited documentation it may be hard to find. I posted my findings to the Raspberry Pi baremetal forum.  The post can be found below.

In terms of changes for this lesson there really isn't any here specifically.  I'll have to modify the solution code in previous lessonsto include the proper alignment and ship the template directory (contains the Makefile, linker script, etc...) with a modified version of the linker file.  Additionally, I should rename the framebuffer file to bufferFrame to remove any issues in the future (reason explained in the forum post)  I could also point out the memory issue to students; however it may be outside the scope of the course.  I'm awaiting response from my forum post before adding my assumptions to the lesson.

Reviving this thread with some information for the Raspberry Pi 2.  I bought a Raspberry Pi 2 a few months ago and wanted to complete Alex's Baking Pi on it.  I've forked the repository and have been making updates to each lesson.  I hope people with the RPi 2 can use it as a resource, you can follow my progress here: [url]https://github.com/edargelies/bakingpi-www[/url].  Up until this point I've only really had to deal with changing some peripheral addresses or adjusting address offsets.  I ran into the exact same issue and was stuck for a few days. Finally did some proper debugging with the LEDs to figure out what was going on.  Merely adding the incbin in the drawing.s file broke everything, I don't even need to implement the DrawCharacter or DrawString functions.  Looking at the memory map it isn't immediately apparent why.  Before and after adding the incbin code I noticed the address of the framebufferinfo increases by 0x900 which seemingly is enough to make it unacceptable as Alex said.  First I tried messing with the sections in the linker file and ended up with this:

kernel.ld
[code]
/******************************************************************************
*	kernel.ld
*	 by Alex Chadwick
*
*	A linker script for generation of raspberry pi kernel images.
******************************************************************************/

SECTIONS {
	/*

        * be run first. We allow room for the ATAGs and stack and conform to 
        * the bootloader's expectation by putting this code at 0x8000.
	*/
	.init 0x8000 : {
		*(.init)
	}
	
	/* 
	* Next we put the data.
	*/
	.data 0x9000 : {
		*(.data)
	}

	/* 
	* Next we put the rest of the code.
	*/
	.text 0xA000 : {
		*(.text)
	}

	/*

	* sections into this section, which will be discarded by default.
	*/
	/DISCARD/ : {
		*(*)
	}
}
[/code]

I wanted to have a clearly defined section for data and text so I explicitly stated their locations.  I also switched the positions, data appears first after the init block rather than second here.  For a larger kernel this may be an issue, but for what were doing this is plenty of space.  Obviously this didn't fix the problem, but is half of the solution.  A somewhat hacky fix is renaming the framebuffer.s file to bufferframe.s.  The make file builds everything in alphabetical order, so when we added data to the drawing.s file, the data was mapped before the framebuffer.s file's data, increasing the address.  Calling it bufferFrame puts it first to compile in the make file so the FrameBufferInfo gets the first spot in the data field at 0x9000 (you can confirm with the kernel.map file).  

kernel.map
[code]
.data           0x0000000000009000      0xa28
 *(.data)

 .data          0x0000000000009a04       0x24 build/tags.o
[/code]

Additionally you could just modify the make file to build the framebuffer file first.  After doing so I just played with the alignment and order of the data sections a bit and I was printing the cmdline.  Thrilling.  Here's how the data sections of "bufferFrame.s" and drawing.s look now:

bufferFrame.s
[code]
.section .data
.align 4
@ .globl FrameBufferInfo 
FrameBufferInfo:
	.int 1024	/* #0 Width */
	.int 768	/* #4 Height */
	.int 1024	/* #8 vWidth */
	.int 768	/* #12 vHeight */
	.int 0		/* #16 GPU - Pitch */
	.int 16		/* #20 Bit Depth */
	.int 0		/* #24 X */
	.int 0		/* #28 Y */
	.int 0		/* #32 GPU - Pointer */
	.int 0		/* #36 GPU - Size */
[/code]
I removed the global lable to FrameBufferInfo as I didn't see any other files using it.

drawing.s
[code]
.section .data
.align 8
font:
	.incbin "font.bin"

.align 1
foreColour:
	.hword 0xFFFF

.align 2
graphicsAddress:
	.int 0
[/code]

It was a huge relief to get it working, but I'm still curious why. It seems there is a happy zone in memory where the FrameBufferInfo structure lives. My thought was the FrameBufferInfo must live somewhere that both the CPU and GPU can access? I was under the impression that all memory is not accessible by both. Perhaps placing the font.bin data removed it from that happy place? I haven't seen any documentation that confirms this, it's just a thought. Maybe someone on the forum could enlighten me. If you're still having issues, check my github, I should have a solution posted shortly.
